# Release Summary

This release ensures compatibility with
kubernets.openshift\_virtualization &gt;=5.2.0,&lt;7.0.0. changes.

# Minor Changes

-   Bump dependency on kubernetes.openshift\_virtualization and
    collection version
    [\#192](https://github.com/redhat/redhat.openshift_virtualization/pull/192)

## v2.2.2

# Release Summary

This is a maintenance release to trigger a rebuild. No functional
changes.

## v2.2.1

# Release Summary

This release brings some new features and enables compatibility with
ansible-openshift\_virtualization-2.19. The inventory now tries to
lookup winrm services for Windows hosts if enabled. The
unset\_ansible\_port option was added to the inventory. It allows to
control if the value of ansible\_port should be unset if no non-default
value was found. The hidden\_fields argument was added to redhat\_vm and
[redhat](){vm,vmi}\_info which allows to hide and ignore certain fields
in the returned definition of a VM or VMI. If no namespaces were
configured the inventory now tries to use OCP Projects if available. It
is now possible to switch between running and run\_strategy with
redhat\_vm. This is a maintenance release with no functional changes
compared to version 2.2.0. Only the changelog was fixed.

cluster from which an inventory is built.
